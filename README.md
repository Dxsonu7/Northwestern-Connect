# Northwestern-Connect
Student built application for thousands of students to streamline productivity and avoid distractions. One app for everything, everything at one place!


# How I got here?

This is my fourth year at Northwestern, and I've witnessed numerous initiatives aimed at connecting and streamlining events, activities, chapel, dining, and class schedules. Many efforts have been launched to address these areas and their challenges. I've spoken with leaders of these initiatives, and most of them mentioned that past failures occurred because we relied on third-party software or organizations whose engineers didn't engage directly with students, professors, and staff. Every semester, hundreds of hours are spent manually distributing, collecting, and processing chapel cards to assign credits to students. Why not streamline this with a one-tap functionality, saving not only time but also thousands of dollars? The college could redirect these savings to other departments and needs. This application could be scaled to other areas like campus dining, SAC events, and class schedules, bringing everything together in one place. Moreover, students dislike navigating multiple websites and apps. This application would centralize and simplify access to class schedules, chapel time and credits, meal plans, daily schedules, and more. It would save staffs' hundreds of hours and help students avoid wasting time seeking information across various platforms. By implementing this centralized system, the college would also save money, which could be reinvested in creating more work-study roles rather than paying third-party software companies that don't prioritize student needs. The timeline for this project could start immediately and take up to six months to gather requirements, plan, build, and deploy the application. This app, built by students for students, will significantly improve campus life and operations.
