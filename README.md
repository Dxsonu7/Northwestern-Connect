<h6> Why itâ€™s needed </h6>
This is my fouth year here at Northwestern. I have seen so many initiative to connect and streamline events, activities, chapel, dining, class schedules. So many initiatives have to started to fix these areas and their problem. I have to talked to leaders of these initiatives most of them said these have failed in past because either we have been using a 3rd party software or we were relying on organization whose engineers didn't interact one-one to build a software for students, professors and its staff. It costs several hundreds of hours to manually distribute, collect, and read chapel card every semester and assign credits to students. Why not streamline this in one tap functionalty, saving not only hundreds of hours but also thousands of dollars. College can use this money somewhere else to streamline other departments and needs. This application can be scaled to other areas like campus dinning, SAC events, Class schedule, and everything can live in one application. On top of everything, students don't like to going to 10 different places, websites, and apps. Why can't we have all of these and more at one place and in one app, built and improved based on needs and demands of student body. Students are the owner of the app and not the other way around. 

Northwestern-Connect is student led and built software.
